## Stop interfering in Mueller investigation and the FBI

The FBI and the Mueller investigation are being attacked by the president and Republicans in Congress. The reason is obvious. There is serious evidence against the president and people who work for him. They are trying to prevent the investigation from going forward. We insist that it must. 

We, the American people, want to know what the president has done, who he is influenced by, in debt to. What his conflicts of interest are. How our country is being led. We want to know how the 2016 election was hacked, so we can add security to prevent it from happening again. Most important, we insist on the rule of law, that no person is above the law, and that includes the president. 

Our support for Mueller and the FBI is not partisan. We are not all Democrats or Republicans or independents. We come from all over the US, red states and blue. We just want to know what happened, and the FBI and Mueller appear to be the only ones who can. 

We demand that the president, congressional Republicans, and their supporters stop interfering with and obstructing the Mueller investigation and the FBI. Let the investigation run its course.�
