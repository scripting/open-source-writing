## Stop interfering with the Mueller investigation

Donald Trump, president of the United States, has a strange and as yet undetermined relationship with Russia. He probably owes them a lot of money. We need to know about this. Since the president hasn't been forthcoming, we're using Mueller and the FBI.

As American voters, taxpayers and citizens, of all parties, from all states, we demand that the president, congressional Republicans, and their supporters stop obstructing the Mueller investigation and the FBI. Let the investigation run its course.
