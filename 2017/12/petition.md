## Stop interfering with the Mueller investigation

Donald Trump, president of the United States, has an undetermined relationship with Russia. We need to understand his financial, political, and other ties to Russia. Since the president hasn't been forthcoming, we are relying on the Mueller investigation and the FBI.

As American voters, taxpayers and citizens, of all political parties, and from every state in our country, we demand that the President, and members of Congress stop undermining and obstructing the Mueller investigation and the FBI. Let the investigation run its course unhindered so that we all may understand whatever current or former relationships exist or existed.
