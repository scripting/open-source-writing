## Open source writing

Let's try using the tools of open source to distribute not just bits of code, but also ideas. 

### Background

People write stuff on Facebook and say it's okay to copy-paste the text into other posts, as a way of getting around Facebook's rules about sharing and friends. Sometimes if you share someone else's post there are limits who can see it. If you want an idea to travel far and wide then you encourage people to copy-paste. 

It seems to me they are reinventing the idea of open source and  Creative Commons licenses. 

### Inspiration

The other day I wrote something that I thought was important enough to want people to share it without worrying about attribution. Some ideas just need to get out there. 

The idea in this case was political. People see the FBI as working for either the Democrats or Republicans, but they actually work for the country. They are governed by the Constitution. That's the strength of our country. I wanted to explain, in that context, what the FBI is doing in regard to Trump and Russia. 

I'm a voter, taxpayer and proud citizen of the United States. I vote according to my interests, at times voting for members of both parties. I am not part of the news business. I am just me. As an American I want the FBI to continue to find out what Trump's relationship to Russia is, and how they screwed around with our election, and how we can protect ourselves now and in the future. 

I am also a software developer and technologist. So how we do that is of special concern to me. I might be able to help. But I can't get there through the news industry or the two political parties. They aren't paying attention to people like me. They see me as either an eyeball or a contributor. Neither are interested in my ideas. 

Let's try using the tools of open source to distribute not just bits of code, but also ideas. That's what I'm trying to do here on this repo.
