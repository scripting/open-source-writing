I had a thought about #metoo the other day. I assume that I will be <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word-excoriate">excoriated</a> for this. It's okay. But that's my point actually. If #metoo can get control of that it can be orders of magnitude more effective, more quickly, imho. I look at the restrtaint of #blacklivesmatter with great <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/17/0880.html">admiration</a>. If the two causes could cooperate, and if #metoo can adopt some of the peaceful coexistence approach of #blm (as I see it), we can all soar. That's what I hope to see.
